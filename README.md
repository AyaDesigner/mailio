### Mailio: a simple mailman sending messages from a mobile without internet connection using QR code
We propose an app that would allow refugees and isolated people to create offline messages and then have those messages carried to places with connectivity and then being sent to the intended recipients.
The app allows you to create a QR code that contains an encoded message (right to privacy). That message can then be scanned by someone that has internet access so it can be sent. The app also allows anyone else to send a message back, by storing the response offline, as a QR code that can then be scanned by the refugee with the app, decoded, and displayed.
